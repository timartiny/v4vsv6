# Back-up scanner
These scripts can be run on back-up scanners to help verify no network interference is ocurring.

The paths that are listed here are relative to a box we use, and may not exist on other boxes, beware.

Additionally the `pcap-A*` scripts are for simply pcaping in case something weird happens and we want to track it down, nothing from those files is used later on, and can be skipped if desired.
